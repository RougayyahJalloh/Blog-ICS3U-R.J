        <h2>Day 1</h2> 
<strong>Monday March 19th, 2018</strong> <br><br>Today I was able to create my first blog. The purpose of this blog is 
 to write<br> about all the interesting things I've learnt and managed to do using things<br>like 'html', 'processing', 
'css' and many other amazing computer programming languages. A couple weeks ago, I learned how to create a website about 
computer hardware using the html language. At first, it was <br> a little confusing to set up the website, but with the 
help of Khan Academy, I <br> was able to set up the basis of my website. I then used atom to continue imputing the informmation 
that I found regarding archival devices as well<br> as add images to help make my website more visually appealing. 
Finally, I learned about number systems <em>(binary, octal, hexadecimal, etc.)</em> and their <br>importance in imput 
and output devices. Lastly, I was able to create two<br>images using processing. In processing, I used functions like: 
stroke() and fill().               
        
<h3>Things I learnt </h3>
I learnt many things by doing this project about Archival Devices (Printers & Tape Storage) as well as other
computer hardware systems. The first being how printers were originally created. When printing was invented, it was 
noted that there was a general desire in people forlearning throughout Europe and this invention made books cheaper and 
improved the ability in people to read more books. Although, it was kind of difficult to find a direct link of printers to number 
systems, I was able to find out more about how binary coding is used for colour (RGB) in digital imaging. 

<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
Although, I was able to learn many things about archival devices, their importance in our society and how number systems 
are closely related to how printers are able to function, there are many things I would still like to learn about archival devices 
and computer hardware in general. For example, I would like to learn more about the process of printing.
        
         <h2>Day 2</h2> 
<strong>Monday March 19th, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I continued working on my processing example excersizes. Two weeks ago,<br> I was able to complete a picture of a house with a front lawn and a sun setting beisde the house. The next picture I completed was a series of semi-cicles of different sizes, colours and lengths.         
        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
I learnt how to draw my semi circles for the second exercise using the arc(_,_,_,_ PI / _, _ * PI / _); // __ degrees function. That ultimately helped me create a colourful semi-circle. I also learned how to create circles that moves as I move my mouse. I did that by using the fill(mouseX,mouseY,_); ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, _, _);function. 


<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
I had problems being able to create a gif for my last exercise to show the circles moving. In the future I would like to learn how to do that.
