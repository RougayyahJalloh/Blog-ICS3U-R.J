        <h2>Day 1</h2> 
        <strong>Monday March 19th, 2018</strong> <br><br>Today I was able to create my first blog. The purpose of this blog is to write<br> about all the interesting things I've learnt and managed to do using things<br>like 'html', 'processing', 'css' and many other amazing computer programming languages. A couple weeks ago, I learned how to create a website about computer hardware using the html language. At first, it was <br> a little confusing to set up the website, but with the help of Khan Academy, I <br> was able to set up the basis of my website. I then used atom to continue imputing the informmation that I found regarding archival devices as well<br> as add images to help make my website more visually appealing. Finally, I learned about number systems <em>(binary, octal, hexadecimal, etc.)</em> and their <br>importance in imput and output devices. Lastly, I was able to create two<br>images using processing. In processing, I used functions like: stroke() and fill().
