        <h2>Day 1</h2> 
<strong>Monday March 19th, 2018</strong> <br><br>Today I was able to create my first blog. The purpose of this blog is 
 to write<br> about all the interesting things I've learnt and managed to do using things<br>like 'html', 'processing', 
'css' and many other amazing computer programming languages. A couple weeks ago, I learned how to create a website about 
computer hardware using the html language. At first, it was <br> a little confusing to set up the website, but with the 
help of Khan Academy, I <br> was able to set up the basis of my website. I then used atom to continue imputing the informmation 
that I found regarding archival devices as well<br> as add images to help make my website more visually appealing. 
Finally, I learned about number systems <em>(binary, octal, hexadecimal, etc.)</em> and their <br>importance in imput 
and output devices. Lastly, I was able to create two<br>images using processing. In processing, I used functions like: 
stroke() and fill().               
        
<h3>Things I learnt </h3>
I learnt many things by doing this project about Archival Devices (Printers & Tape Storage) as well as other
computer hardware systems. The first being how printers were originally created. When printing was invented, it was 
noted that there was a general desire in people forlearning throughout Europe and this invention made books cheaper and 
improved the ability in people to read more books. Although, it was kind of difficult to find a direct link of printers to number 
systems, I was able to find out more about how binary coding is used for colour (RGB) in digital imaging. 

<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
Although, I was able to learn many things about archival devices, their importance in our society and how number systems 
are closely related to how printers are able to function, there are many things I would still like to learn about archival devices 
and computer hardware in general. For example, I would like to learn more about the process of printing.
        
         <h2>Day 2</h2> 
<strong>Tuesday March 20th, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I continued working on my processing example excersizes. 
Two weeks ago,<br> I was able to complete a picture of a house with a front lawn and a sun setting beisde the house. 
 The next picture I completed was a series of semi-cicles of different sizes, colours and lengths.         
        
        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
I learnt how to draw my semi circles for the second exercise using the arc(_,_,_,_ PI / _, _ * PI / _); // __ degrees function. 
That ultimately helped me create a colourful semi-circle. 


<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
I would still like to learn how to perfect my semi-circles and make them different thicknesses and lengths without 
 it affecting the overall look of my picture. 

<h2>Day 3</h2> 
<strong> Wednesday March 21st, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I continued doing the practice exercises
 to prepare for the first assignment. I continued with exercise 3 and managed to get it done before the period ended. 

        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
I learnt how to move the ellipses I have created around using the "mouseX" and "mouseY" functions. 
I was a bit confused at first about where I should put those commands in order to control the movement of my circles 
but after some trial and erro I learned the commands had to be added to both my 'fill' and 'stroke' functions.<br><br>  
 <strong>Here is an example:</strong> <br>

<br> <em>fill(mouseX,mouseY,255);
 <br>ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 70, 70);</em>
 <br> <br>The rest of my code for exercise 3 can be found using this 
  link:<br> https://github.com/RougayyahJalloh/Processing-Exercise-Set-A/blob/master/Exercise3/Exercise3-Code

<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
I had problems being able to create a gif for my last exercise to show the circles moving. In the future I would like to
   learn how to do that. 

<h2>Day 4</h2> 
<strong>Thursday March 22nd, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I was able to complete my 4th exercise for the practice exercises. 
  The goal for this exercise was to create a colour specter that moves down and across the screen. To do that, I needed to make 
   use of the colorMode(HSB) and % functions. 

        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
After several trials, I managed to use the colorMode(HSB) function to create the colour gradiant I wanted for my 
 image as well as set up my variables for my images. 


<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
I would like to learn how to improve the colour scheme of my image. I did have some issues with the amount of red being 
 produced even when I tried changing the number for the 'fill' and colorMode(HSB) functions.  

<h2>Day 5</h2> 
<strong>Friday March 22nd, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I finished the 5th exercise for the practice processing 
exercises. This exercise was faily simple since I already had practice creating multiple ellipses from previous exercises 
like exercise 3. This exercise however, is a combination of both exercise 3 and 4. The movement of the circles had to be 
automatic and didn't need the "mouseX" and "mouseY" functions like in exercise 3 and needed variables like in exercise 4. 

        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
I learned how to combine what I learned from the two previous exercises in order to create a row of circles 
(that are different colours) that continuously move up and down using my variables. 


<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
Like I mentioned the day before, I had a difficult time with the amount of 
red being produced even when I change the numbers in my 'stroke' and 'fill' so I would like to learn how to have a more
colourful range or colours in the future.  


<h2>Day 6</h2> 
<strong>Monday March 26th, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I started working on the 6th exercise for the practice exercises. 
This was by far the hardest one to create so far since I had no prior knowledge of how to use 'while' statements.  

        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
Today was mostly trial and error and honestly, I haven't gotten much done regarding this exercise.  


<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
At the moment, I am still doing research on how to add my 'while' function in order to create my grid of circles. 
As well as control their movement without only creating one circle at a time like the previous exercises.   
        
        
        <h2>Day 7</h2> 
<strong>Tuesday March 27th, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I continued working on exercise 6 with not much luck. I asked
 another friend to review my code to see if there were any changes I could make in order to get the right approach for 
 this exercise. She didn't have much clue so we tried looking up videos on how to create a grid of circles that could be
  controlled (appear and disappear) using the "mouse" fucntion. 

        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
We watched a couple videos from Daniel Shiffman (a well-known programmer) and he taught us how to create a grid using ellipses. 


<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
Although we learned how to create a 'grid' using ellipses, it wasn't exactly what we were looking for and the grid did not 
ressemble the example we had to re-create. As of right now, I am still trying to learn how to use my while function in order to create the image.    
        
        <h2>Day 8</h2> 
<strong>Wednesday March 28th, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I was finally able to finish exercise 6 with a little help from a
fellow classmate. I also finished the last exercise for the practice exercises since the example was very similar exercise 6. 

        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
My classmate told me that if I was going to use the while function, I would also have to use an 'if' and 'else' statement 
to controle the flow of my fill and stroke statements. For exercise 7, I used the colourMode(HSB) for the gradient for my large 
circle on the bottom and created a grid of circles on the top using the same functions as exercise 6.  


<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
Although I managed to get exercise 6 done with some idea of how to use my if and else function, I would 
still like to know when exactly I'm supposed to be using those functions and their overall importance in processing. 

<h2>Day 9</h2> 
<strong>Thursday March 29th, 2018</strong><br><br>Today,I tried organizing all my code, pictures and gifs I created 
using this webite called: gif.maker, into different folders in order to make my repository neat, organized and easy to follow. 
I divided the folders based on the exersie. Ex. <em> Exercise 1, Exercise 2</em> and so on.. Within thsoe folders, I created a 
file for the code, a file containing a screenshot of the image I created using that code on processing as well as the gif I 
created using an online website.  

        <h3>Things I learnt </h3>
I learned that GitHub is a very useful website to create repositories for projects 
I am working on. I have to choice of making it public for others to see, creating sub folders to stay organized and initialize 
the Read.Me so when I look back at the work I've done, it won't be as complicated to read. I am able to add comments each time 
I make an edit so next time I come back to that document, I can pick up where I left of. Git Hub is definitely a useful and 
very handy tool for my projects. I also learned how to create a gif using several screenshots of the images I created using 
processing.   


<h3>Things I still want to learn </h3>
Since I am stil a newbie to Git Hub, I still feel like there is so much 
        more to learn regarding the website, like how to branch and create a better workflow in the future.
